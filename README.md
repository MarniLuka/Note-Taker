## Credits
Starter code was provided by the [GATech Coding Bootcamp](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).

Worked with [Alex Seidensticker](https://github.com/koi-as) and [James Uebele](https://github.com/Juebele), other members of the Coding Bootcamp, to help work through some of the logic together and for another set of eyes to debug my code.
